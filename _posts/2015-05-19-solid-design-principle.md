title: What is SOLID (an oop design principle) all about ?
---

Why Design Principle ? Design principles are all about providing guidelines for building healthy software. It's like saying "an apple in a day keeps the doctor away".
Saying so, is not the only way to live, it is rather a guideline to live a healthy life. In a similar way, SOLID (an acronym) is an object oriented design principle to build a healthy
software.  

Principle                             |Its all about
:-------------------------------------|:-------------
*S* (Single Responsibility Principle) |Identifying classes based on responsibilities in the context of current application
*O* (Open-Closed Principle)           |Identifying abstractions
*L* (Liskov substitution principle)   |Review implementations that don't really fit the abstraction, rather are look alikes. Create specific abstractions or classes based on the need.
*I* (Interface Segregation Principle) |Review abstractions & improve by breaking them down to more specific abstractions based on the need.
*D* (Dependency *Inversion* Principle)|Implement class dependencies or relations such that classes depend on abstractions and not concrete implementations.

title: What is SOLID (an oop design principle) all about ?
---

Why Design Principle ? Design principles are all about providing guidelines for building healthy software. It's like saying "an apple in a day keeps the doctor away".
Saying so, is not the only way to live, it is rather a guideline to live a healthy life. In a similar way, SOLID (an acronym) is an object oriented design principle to build a healthy
software.  

S ingle Responsibility Principle

I dentifying classes based on responsibilities in the context of current application
**O** Open-Closed Principle
:	Identifying abstractions
L iskov substitution principle   	
:	Review implementations that don't really fit the abstraction, rather are look alikes. Create specific abstractions or classes based on the need.
I nterface Segregation Principle 	
:	Review abstractions & improve by breaking them down to more specific abstractions based on the need.
D ependency *Inversion* Principle	
:	Implement class dependencies or relations such that classes depend on abstractions and not concrete implementations.
